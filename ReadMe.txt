WORKING THE APPLICATION

To set up the app on your computer you will need to "npm install" in the shop_app directory and the client directory.

Once this is done use the "npm start" on the shop_app directory.

Once this is done you will be able to run the app on "http://localhost:3000/"

The voucher codes are five, ten and fifteen for their respective offers. You can only apply one voucher at a time. You will not be able to apply a voucher that is not working.

GOAL

All of the requested functions have been completed.

FUTURE STEPS

With more time I would have like to make the functionality smoother allowing you to add and remove multiple items from the basket with the one click.
